* Misc
** Provide information, not act
Objective is not to *act* on information, but to *provide* information.
So if I find the enemy HQ to be at [34 45] I succeed and do not have to also attack.
So how is finding a location rewarded? What are the mechanics?

???
A game where exposing enemy information will provide "damage".
In Red Alert we do not consern about maintaining tanks or the personel.
What is a level further up where we do not consern about the tanks? When do we hit only information?

** Attacking 45,78 with 1000 units
Initial cost: 100 + 900/4 = 325
Left: 675
Loses: 2-3
If predicted by enemy: 5-1
