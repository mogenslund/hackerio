                            Submarine Activity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greetings Agent

We have been tracking a submarine for some time and it would be of highest
importance, if we can connect it to some activities near Alexeandria.

Parts of the submarines log is located ./files/submarine1.txt 

Coordinates are difficult to understand and the only clue we have got is
something called "Dive18".

Objective:
  > Find the date and time when the submarine was located near Alexandria

Instructions:
  - Analyze and understand the log ./files/submarine1.txt
  - Use GPS coordinates to figure out when it was near Alaxandria
  - Check the result:
      echo -n 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM.SS' | md5sum
    should equal 0f48ef057244d72fb0f1c56cc9542ac7
