Thank you for helping out with Mission 1!

We have another assignment for you. We have been monitoring calendar data online
and we have come across something suspicious. Parts of the calendar is saved in
the file ./files/cal1.txt. We need to know who owns it.

Objective:
  > Find the full name of the owner of the data in ./files/cal1.txt

Instructions:
  - Look through the data and see if there are any hints to follow.
  - Check the result:
      echo -n 'FIRSTNAME LASTNAME' | md5sum
    should equal 74ca39cad0c7a6f4c26d3b8cd0df8d8e
