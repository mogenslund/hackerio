Mission solution MD5 hashes:

    Mission 1: b3655a22dd7ca6c5710110eb91cf2536
    Mission 2: ?????

The solution to Mission 1 is your level1 key. So

    echo -n "level1" | md5sum

Should equal "b3655a22dd7ca6c5710110eb91cf2536" when level1 is replaced with its
value.

There might be cases where a level key is needed to encrypt some content.
