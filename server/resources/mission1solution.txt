                                 Mission 1
                              -- Solution --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Call the endpoint:

  <host>/contacts/list

Use curl, a browser or some other tool.

Search for Ripper on the list. Notice that his ID is 2206. Call the endpoint
with the id:

  <host>/contacts/2206

From the record his birthdate is 1966-12-11. Report the date back to HQ by
calling:

  <host>/messages/send/mission1=1966-12-11

This call will not provide the feedback directly. Instead you get a url for a
response. Similar to this:

   <host>/messages/read/805f1f80-5e90-4867-af91-760014e8a81b

but probably with another id.

It will take some seconds to process your request. When it is ready the url will
show the feedback. Until then the response will be:

  "Message in progress"

Call the url regularly, until something like this shows up:

  SUCCESS
  You have completed mission1

  Next mission:

    <host>/mission2-19adc26d6

Since the solution was correct, a url for the next mission is provided.
