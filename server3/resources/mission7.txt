Greetings Agent

A reliable source, in the city of Moscow, have detected some suspicious radio
communication. We need to intercept the transmissions.

To support the operation, hidden in a warehouse nearby are some drones.

Activate a drone by calling

  * <host>/drone?type=moscow

An id will be returned. Use it to control the drone through this syntax:

  * <host>/drone?id=<id>&speed=200&direction=e

If the drone gets to far from the base or runs out of battery, it will be lost.

We expect the drone will be able to pick up the transmissions when close enough
to this location:

  * Latitude: 55.75275
  * Longitude: 37.61740

Objective:
  > Navigate a drone to the specified location and capture the message

References:
  * <host>/drone
  * <host>/drone?type=moscow
  * <host>/drone?id=<id>&speed=200&direction=e
  * <host>/msg?to=hq&msg=<msg>
  * <host>/msg?id=<messageid>
