--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the interface for drones.

To create a new drone use the url:

  * <host>/drone?type=<type>

For example:

  * <host>/drone?type=moscow

An id will be returned, which is used to get information from the drone and to
control it. To update and get information use the url:

  * <host>/drone?id=<id>&speed=<speed>&direction=<direction>

For example:

  * <host>/drone?id=<id>&speed=200&direction=nw

or 

  * <host>/drone?id=<id>&speed=200&direction=45

Speed must be a number between 0 and 200, setting the speed in km/h.

Direction is either in degress 0-360 or compass directions:

             n

        nw       ne

      w             e

        sw       se

             s

To only get info, just call:

  * <host>/drone?id=<id>

If the drone gets too far from its base or runs out of battery, it will be lost.
