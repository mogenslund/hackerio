Greetings Agent

This is urgent!

We have got intel from a reliable source that a coordinated nuclear attack is
about to initiated. It is planned to happen tomorrow at 20:30 and it is expected
to hit 3 cities. We need to know the location of the launch site to prevent the
attacks.

All we have is a logfile from this server controlling the launch:

 * <host>/file3423121

Objective:
  > Find the city where the nuclear attack server is located

Instructions:
  - Use the log file and any available source to locate the launch site
