                          YOU HAVE ENTERED HACKERIO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a member of HackerIO, an elite team of hackers providing intelligence to the
government, your skills will be put to the test. Cautious measures have been
taken to ensure that team members remain anonymous to one another and to the
government. Your mission will be delivered to you through this site and all
feedback must be given through this site as well. You will not be informed of
the purpose of the intelligence you gather. Other teams are responsible for
carrying out the more delicate tasks.

Your first mission is a training mission, designed to test your capabilities as
a candidate. Access to more advanced missions will only be granted upon
successful completion of previous missions. It is crucial that you save the
unique URLs provided, as failure to do so will result in having to start over.

Your first mission can be found at:

    <host>/mission1

Be prepared to use specialized tools to access the endpoints, such as

- A browser
- Postman
- Curl: curl <host>/mission1
- Nodejs: fetch('<host>/mission1')
            .then(r => r.text())
            .then(t => console.log(t))
- PowerShell: Invoke-RestMethod -Uri <host>/mission1

If you are not familiar with any of these tools, you may not be the right
candidate. Good luck, Agent.
