Greetings Agent

You are hereby activated for mission 3: Off guard.

We have reasons to believe that Ghost Corp is storing sensitive information in
Warehouse 43. There is a guard patrolling the area around the clock, making it
difficult for us to gather more information.

However, one of our agents has successfully planted a tracker on the guard's
vehicle.

Objective:
  > Find out when the guard is furthest away from the warehouse
  > Report the time back to HQ

Instructions:
  - Monitor the data from the tracker to determine at what time of the day the
    guard is the furthest away from the warehouse.
  - Use the secure messaging system to send the time of day (in 4-digit format,
    like "1845") back to HQ.
